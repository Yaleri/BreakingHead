Breaking Head
=============

###Open source card game about the Drupal.org issue queue.

**This game makes the assumption that there are bad people in the issue queue on drupal.org - this is not the case! Luckily the Drupal community consists of very friendly contributors always willing to help each other. But sometimes working in the queue can be depressing and this game covers situations when people have the feeling that progress is willingly blocked for no good reason.**

About the game
--------------

This game is based on the card game [Saboteur designed by Frederic Moyersoen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saboteur_\(card_game\)) where players are either assigned the role of the good *contributor* or the bad *blocker*.

Further details can be found in the game manual.

####Directory structure

- **/cards/**: Contains all data about the actual playing cards
- **/cards/build.sh**: Script to automatically generate the cards from the src/ folder to the build/ folder.
- **/cards/build/**: The generated cards, ready for printing.
- **/cards/src/**: The source images of the cards, need to be processed first.
- **/cards/src/back/**: The card back-images. (Named by "[group-name].png")
- **/cards/src/front/**: Contains the group names of card front images as folders.
- **/cards/src/front/[group-name]/**: Contains the types of cards as folders and the card layout-overlays.
- **/cards/src/front/[group-name]/__layout/**: Contains the layout-overlay images that will be composited on top of the card images. Each overlay file is named like [group-name].png. All card images of these groups will be composited with that overlay image.
- **/cards/src/front/[group-name]/[card-type]/**: Contains all the card images of this type and group. These images are dummy-images at the beginning and need to be replaced with appropriate ones.
- **/manual/**: Contains the game manual (editable and as PDF)
- **/packaging/**: Contains the game packaging design.

####What the /cards/build.sh-script does

It basically copies all images from the recursive src/front folder over the the flat build/ directory.
Additionally it determines the appropriate card back-image and moves it to the build/ directory for each group of cards.
When there are layout-overlay images in "__layout" folders with proplerly named .png files, it will composit them with their card images.
As a result all the card fronts should be available as build/[group-name]/[serial number beginning at 1]-[image name].png and the cards back for the whole group should be prefixed with "0-". 


####Suitable images???

**playable cards**, are cards that the players can use during the game.
- **playable/block**: Cards that block other players (3 different types, each one has 3 similar pictures). Examples: A broken GIT head, lost internet connection
- **playable/unblock**: Cards that un-block other players (Same 3 types as the blocking cards, each 2 similar pictures; Additionally 3 cards mixing the types with each other (unblocks 1/2, 1/3 and 2/3)).
- **playable/path**: Cards that are the paths to walk on for the players (5 crossings, 8 curves of 2 kinds, 10 junctions of 2 kinds, 7 straight paths of 2 kinds). Examples: Funny issue comments, comments with patches.
- **playable/deadend**: Cards that are blocked paths where players are unable to walk on (1 crossing-deadend, 2 curved-deadends, 2 total deadends, 2 junction and 2 straight deadends). Examples: Issue comments setting to needs work.
- **playable/destroypath**: Cards that can destroy paths or deadends when played (3 similar pictures). Examples: Spam comments.
- **playable/viewend**: Cards that enable a user to have a look at one of the end cards when played (6 similar pictures). Examples: Pictures of smiling Dries.

**player cards**, are cards that assign the players their role.
- **contributor**: Cards that assign players the good contributor role. Examples: Happy core committers.
- **blocker**: Cards that assign players the bad blocker role. Examples: Angry core committers.

**special cards**, are cards that have a special role during the game.
- **end**: The end cards (2 wrong-end cards and 1 correct-end card). Examples: Patch needs reroll, Committed!
- **start**: The path start-card. Example: An issue summary.

**Make sure that the usage of the images is compatible with the GPLv2 license!**

Status
------

This game is still a work-in-progress and you can add your own cards!

- [X] Implement a script to automatically build cards based on layouts and images
- [ ] Add suitable images for all cards (at the moment there is only a dummy image for each card)
- [ ] Create a pictured game manual based on the original
- [ ] Design a packaging for the cards
- [ ] Print a prototype of the game, make pictures and add them to the game manual
- [ ] Test the prototype and fix issues with the images
- [ ] Print and distribute the game on the next drupal camp and cons?

####Printing
